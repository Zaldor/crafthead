I run a small design agency and need a portfolio site using Astro and Decap CMS.
Start in English only, but design everything so it’s easy to add Italian later with your suffix-based i18n.
Pages: home, services, projects (with case studies), about, and contact.
Use your atomic design system and propose the content models you’ll use for projects and case studies.
Please begin with your discovery phase.
